This module is a part of the [Pip.Services](http://pipservices.org) polyglot microservices toolkit.

The rpc module provides the synchronous communication using local calls or the HTTP(S) protocol. It contains both server and client side implementations.

The module contains the following packages:
- **Auth** - authentication and authorisation components
- **Build** - HTTP service factory
- **Clients** - mechanisms for retrieving connection settings from the microserviceâ€™s configuration and providing clients and services with these settings
- **Connect** - helper module to retrieve connections for HTTP-based services and clients
- **Services** - basic implementation of services for connecting via the HTTP/REST protocol and using the Commandable pattern over HTTP
